## What This Agent Does

The **FinOps Agent** applies [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org/) principles to cloud services, giving your team instant, grounded guidance on:

| Domain | Coverage |
|---|---|
| **Azure Cost Management** | Budgets, alerts, reservations, savings plans, right-sizing |
| **Microsoft 365** | E3/E5 licensing, license optimization, usage analytics |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | M365 Copilot licensing, Copilot Studio consumption billing, ROI |
| **Microsoft Foundry** | Token-based pricing, model deployment costs, AI workload optimization |
| **Microsoft Fabric** | Capacity units, workload cost management, reserved capacity |
| **Huawei Cloud** | IAM, VPC, ECS, OBS, RDS, CCE, CDN, WAF, billing and governance |
| **Cross-cloud Analysis** | Azure vs Huawei comparison with source-grounded caveats |
| **FinOps Best Practices** | Chargeback/showback, tagging, budgeting, forecasting, cost allocation |

All answers are **grounded in official provider documentation** through semantic search — no hallucinations, no guesswork.

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy, make sure you have:

- [ ] A **Microsoft 365 tenant** with Copilot Studio license
- [ ] **Copilot Studio** access ([aka.ms/copilotstudio](https://aka.ms/copilotstudio))
- [ ] The **Copilot Studio VS Code extension** installed ([install here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-CopilotStudio.vscode-copilotstudio))
- [ ] **VS Code** (latest stable version)
- [ ] **Git** installed locally

---

## Deploy in 7 Steps

### Step 1 — Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatoromao/copilotstudio-samples-finops.git
cd copilotstudio-samples-finops
```

### Step 2 — Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

### Step 3 — Create a New Agent in Copilot Studio

1. Go to [Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/copilotstudio) and sign in.
2. Click **Create** → **New agent**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. _My FinOps Agent1_) and complete the setup wizard.
4. Once created, note the agent name — you'll use it in the next step.

### Step 4 — Clone Your Agent Locally via the VS Code Extension

1. In VS Code, open the **Copilot Studio** panel from the Activity Bar (left sidebar).
2. Click **Sign in** and authenticate with your Microsoft 365 account.
3. Select the **Environment** where you created the agent.
4. Find your agent in the list and click **Clone** (or **Open locally**) to pull it into a local folder on your machine.

### Step 5 — Copy the FinOps Agent Files into Your Local Agent Folder

From this repository, copy the following files and folders into your locally cloned agent folder, **replacing** any existing files with the same name:

```
FinOps Agent/
├── agent.mcs.yml        ← copy and replace
├── knowledge/           ← copy entire folder and replace
└── topics/              ← copy entire folder and replace
```

> Make any customizations you need at this point — edit `agent.mcs.yml` to adjust instructions, add/remove knowledge sources in `knowledge/`, or modify topics in `topics/`.

### Step 6 — Apply Changes via the Extension

1. Back in VS Code, open the **Copilot Studio** panel.
2. Click **Apply Changes** (or **Publish**) to push your local changes back to Copilot Studio.
3. Wait for the extension to confirm the changes were applied successfully.

### Step 7 — Test in Copilot Studio

1. Open [Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/copilotstudio) and navigate to your agent.
2. Click **Test** in the top-right corner to open the test chat panel.
3. Start a conversation and validate the agent's responses.

## Try It Out

Once deployed, test it with prompts like:

- _"What is the best Azure savings plan for a predictable workload?"_
- _"How do I set up a budget alert in Azure Cost Management?"_
- _"What's the difference between Microsoft 365 E3 and E5 from a cost perspective?"_
- _"How is Microsoft Copilot Studio billed?"_
- _"How do I optimize Microsoft Fabric capacity costs?"_
- _"How do I optimize Huawei ECS and OBS costs for dev/test environments?"_
- _"Compare Azure VM and Huawei ECS cost optimization options."_
